# Restaurant Page

Restaurant page built purely using JS. HTML elements were created in JS and manipulated to be appended to a content div in the HTML. Each content page was implemented in a separate JS file. This project makes uses of ES6 modules which was used to import and export JS files. Each tab page's content is populated or wiped out using event listeners.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JS
- Webpack

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to use the import and export syntax so that I can make each page in their own separate JS file. This project also reinforced my DOM manipulation skills since it required me to create the DOM from scratch using JS. I also learned how to use Webpack to bundle my project.
